How to test trees:
1) pip3 install numpy
2) pip3 install scipy
3) pipe install matplotlib
4) Edit line x, y = load_data(DATA_FILE) in testTrees.py, substitute DATA_FILE with your .mat filepath.
5) Run testTrees.py using python3 (python3 testTrees.py)

How to run:
We implemented our assignment using Python3 with Jupyter Notebook (Ipython Notebook). There are a few steps needed
to run the code on a lab machine:

Installing Ipython3 Notebook:
1) pip3 install ipython
2) pip3 install numpy
3) pip3 install scipy
4) pip3 install matplotlib
5) If there are any other missing libraries try using: pip3 install <library name>
6) cd <our project dir containing DecisionTree.ipynb file>
7) ~/.local/bin/ipython3 notebook
8) A browser should open automatically after a while, if it doesn't, open one and go to localhost:8888
9) Click DecisionTree.ipynb
10) Click on the first cell, hold L-Shift and press Enter, this will run the code in the cell and jump
    to the next cell. It should be possible to just keep pressing L-Shift + Enter repeatedly to
    evaluate all cells. 
OR: visit https://try.jupyter.org/ and uplad file DecisionTree.ipynb
